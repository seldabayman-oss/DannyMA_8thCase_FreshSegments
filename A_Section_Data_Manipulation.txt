Data Exploration and Cleansing

1- Update the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table by modifying the month_year column to be a date data type with the start of the month
2-What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
3-What do you think we should do with these null values in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics
4-How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?
5-Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its total record count in this table
6-What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.
7-Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?

1. Modify month_year Column to Date Type
Task: Update the month_year column in fresh_segments.interest_metrics to have a DATE data type with the start of the month.

-- Update the column to be a date with the start of the month

UPDATE interest_metrics
SET month_year = DATE_TRUNC('month', TO_DATE (month_year, 'YYYY-MM'));

2. Count Records for Each month_year Value
Task: Count the records in fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year, sorted in chronological order with null values appearing first.

-- Count records for each month_year including null values
SELECT 
    month_year, 
    COUNT(*) AS record
FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year IS NULL, month_year;

Analysis:
Null values appear first in the result set due to month_year IS NULL in the ORDER BY clause.
Consider imputing nulls with a default value (e.g., earliest or latest date) or excluding them based on business logic.

3. Handling Null Values in month_year
Question: What should we do with the null values?

Answer:
If the null values represent incomplete or erroneous data, we can:
Impute the missing dates with a placeholder like '1900-01-01'.
Remove the rows with null values if they are not critical for analysis.
If nulls are valid but cannot be replaced, flag them for review in future data quality audits.

4. Count interest_id Values Missing Between Tables
Task: Identify interest_id values in interest_metrics but not in interest_map and vice versa.

-- interest_id in interest_metrics but not in interest_map
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT im.interest_id) AS metrics_not
FROM interest_metrics im
LEFT JOIN interest_map imp ON im.interest_id = map.id
WHERE map.id IS NULL;

-- interest_id in interest_map but not in interest_metrics
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT map.id) AS map_not
FROM interest_map map
LEFT JOIN interest_metrics im ON map.id = im.interest_id
WHERE im.interest_id IS NULL;

5. Summarize Total Records in interest_map by id
Task: Summarize the total record count in the interest_map table by id.

SELECT 
    id, 
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM interest_map
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY total DESC;

6. Type of Join and Validation
Task: Perform a table join for analysis and validate with interest_id = 21246.
Join Type: Use a LEFT JOIN to retain all rows from interest_metrics and bring in corresponding records from interest_map. This ensures we don’t lose data from interest_metrics if there is no match in interest_map.

-- Perform the join
SELECT 
    im.*, 
    map.created_at, 
    map.interest_name
FROM interest_metrics im
LEFT JOIN interest_map map ON im.interest_id = map.id
WHERE im.interest_id = 21246;

Analysis:
Check the resulting columns for interest_id = 21246 to ensure data alignment and accuracy.
Ensure no critical information is missing in the joined output.

7. Validate month_year vs created_at
Task: Check if any month_year values are before created_at in the joined table.

-- Identify records where month_year is before created_at
SELECT 
    im.*, 
    map.created_at
FROM interest_metrics im
LEFT JOIN interest_map map ON im.interest_id = map.id
WHERE im.month_year < map.created_at;

Analysis:
If month_year < created_at, the data may be invalid as the date logic implies an inconsistency.
